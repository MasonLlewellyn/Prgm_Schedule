## Overview
### Description
This application is a "programmatic scheduler".   It's design is pretty experiemntal and weird.  When the application is opened, its appearance is like any other "notes" application, a blank canvas.  The user can type plaintext notes but the applications main feature is that it auto-detects and formats "events" and "reminders".  Scheduling is as simple as selecting which "block" either event or reminder and spevifying its fields.  Events work similarly.  The difference between events and reminders is that events have a given start and end date while reminders are simply displayed at a given instant.  

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Scheduling/Productivity
- **Mobile:** The "programmatic" scheduler can condition events on GPS location and later, maybe other mobile-specific properties.
- **Story:** User can open the application to a blank text view (an empty schedule).  To add events, the user would type auto-completed commands such as "Event" and "Reminder".  These events would auto-suggest their required fields similar to the way XCode auto-suggests code snippets.   
- **Market:**  The whole concept of this application is pretty experimental.  It is designed as a learning experience which is probably really bad in terms of marketing. If it were to be adopted by anyone, it would be power users who would want to quickly create and manage a schedule.  
- **Habit:**  Not necessarily habit-forming but someone could get used to checking it every morning.
- **Scope:**  I think that even an MVP for this application would be interesting to build.
